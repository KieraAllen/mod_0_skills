    2.2.2 While scrolling, look for ads for bootcamps
    2.2.3 Research the schools advertised
  2.3 Peruse https://www.builtincolorado.com/ to learn more about what is available
    2.3.1 Search for Turing
    2.3.2 Search a handful of schools found through previous research
    2.3.3 Create "pros/cons" list of each school
  2.4 Organize a "Top 3" bootcamps list, using pre-determined criteria
    2.4.1 Criteria options for top bootcamp
      2.4.1.1 Size

      2.4.1.8 Percentage of jobs secured by alums
    2.4.2 Sort criteria in order of personal importance
    2.4.3 Determine scale by which to rank criteria
    2.4.5 Decide which schools most resemble your scale of criteria
    2.4.6 Choose the top 3
3 Visit top 3 bootcamps

5 Ask your husband why Turing was his top choice
  5.1 Is it worth it, can he work it, put the thing down flip it and reverse it?
  5.2 Learn about the challenges
  5.3 Get his opinion on how your personality will mesh with the community
6 Apply to Turing
